# Volumegesture
This project **only works on the windows machine** because iOS volume control library was not available.

**The GestureVolumeControl.py file contains the working model of the Volume Gesture Controller**

In order to run the model you will need to download/clone the repository and add the  4 files to your ide.

The GestuerVolumeControl.py file import the first 3 files so you need all the 4 files for the model to work.
